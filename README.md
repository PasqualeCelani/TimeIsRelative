# TimeIsRelative
A challenge for the 2025-2026 Computer Vision course at Sapienza University of Rome has been proposed which is **<ins>determining the time from a given image of an analog clock</ins>**. To make this challenge more interesting the proposal suggests that the use of all deep learning techniques, including Neural Networks and CNNs, be strictly prohibited. For an added twist, I propose a solution relying solely on traditional computer vision methods. Ready to see it in action? Keep reading bellow.

## Quick start

### Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3.12 (any modern version should be also ok) installed.

### Execution steps
1. Clone the repository:  `git clone https://github.com/PasqualeCelani/TimeIsRelative.git`
2. Go to the application directory: `cd TimeIsRelative`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment (Unix): `source ./venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the dependecies of the output project: `pip install -r requirements.txt
6. Run the application: `python main.py`

### Output
A successful run will result in a new window opening, showing an image identical to the one you see below.
